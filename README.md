# 💼 Dhruvi Topiya

This is my personal portfolio website built using React.js. It showcases my academic background, technical skills, real-world projects, hackathon achievements, and includes a contact form powered by EmailJS.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 📩 EmailJS (for contact form)
- 📦 GitHub Pages (for deployment)

- Dynamic project section with MERN stack projects

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for EmailJS configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

Get these values from your [EmailJS dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/).

**Note:** The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to version control. The app will fall back to default values if environment variables are not set.

## 🚀 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
